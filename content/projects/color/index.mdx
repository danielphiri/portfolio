Lani is a ticketing application for events in Zambia. There are 2 versions of the application, one for event hosts and another one for attendees. The platform is available on both Android and iOS. I built Lani using Flutter in order to speed up the build process.

Color (American English), or colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple.

This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

Very colorful.
