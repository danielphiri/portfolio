<h1 data-testid="page-title"> Lani Events </h1>

Lani is a ticketing application for events in Zambia. There are 2 versions of the application, one for event hosts and another one for attendees. The platform is available on both Android and iOS. I built Lani using Flutter in order to speed up the build process.
