<h1 data-testid="page-title"> SoundOff Music </h1>

[SoundOff](https://soundoffmusic.com/) is a social-music application meant to help upcoming music artists to reach their fans. The goal behind the application was to help independent artists who are not yet signed to music labels to monetize their fan bases and more closely connect with their fans. This was a passion project I was recruited for by a collegue. We grew the team to about 10 people working on the project.

The application is like if Twitter was built inside of Spotify or Apple Music. On SoundOff, fans can follow their favorite artists, listen to their music, follow and vote for them in music contests, tip them, directly message them, and more.

Here's how it was built:<br></br>

- Used Swift, SwiftUI and the latest XCode SDK to create the mobile application, exclusively on the App Store with an average rating of 4.8 from over 100 users.<br></br>
- Collaborated with a backend engineer who implemented the GraphQL backend on AWS. <br></br>
- Managed the entire lifecycle of the application from planning and requirement gathering to publishing it on the App Store. <br></br>
- Grew the application from 0 to 4000+ users.<br></br>
- Application got admitted into the 1871 Accelerator LatinX Cohort 8, Google for Startups and Amazon for Startups Programs.<br></br>
