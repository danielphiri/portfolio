<h1 data-testid="page-title"> Lani Events </h1>

[Lani](https://lanievents.net/) is a mobile-first e-ticketing platform that I worked on for events in Zambia. There are 2 versions of the application, one for event hosts and another one for attendees. The platform is available on both Android and iOS. One of the goals building the application was to ensure it's performance in low bandwidth environments and for devices with limited capabilities given the target market. I built the application using Flutter with a realtime backend.
