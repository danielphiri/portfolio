My major's primary goal was to understand how the human mind works by examining it from the perspectives of Computer Science, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Anthropology. My focus was on the computational side of things, which was built around computer science and artificial intelligence.

This meant taking a lot of Computer Science classes, including coursework in [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/), [User Interface Design and Development](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS160/), [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://sp23.datastructur.es), [Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org), among others.

One of the most exciting computer science classes I took was the [iOS Development Decal](https://iosdev.berkeley.edu) in Spring 2017. I enjoyed it so much that I became a Teaching Assistant the following semester. As a Teaching Assistant, I restructured and re-implemented some parts of the Snapchat-clone project, which was one of the larger projects and a pillar for the class. The changes received a lot of positive feedback from students that semester. The following semester, I was appointed as 1 of the 3 Core Instructors for the class. We were supported by a team of about 8 Teaching Assistants to teach iOS Development concepts to a class of about 100 students. We had to run everything for the class, including creating and grading assignments, giving lectures, running labs and office hours, among other tasks. It was one of the most fulfilling experiences I had at the school.

<i> 2021 - 2024 </i>

As a Software Engineer, I have always been fascinated by cybersecurity and the critical role it plays in our connected world. That's why I decided to pursue a Master of Cybersecurity Management degree online while continuing to work full-time.

Through the program, I have gained a deep understanding of cybersecurity risk management, compliance, and security operations. I have also developed practical skills in designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies that align with industry standards and regulations. 

The program's flexible online format has allowed me to balance my studies with my work commitments, applying the knowledge and skills I have acquired to real-world scenarios.
Although my previous company recently went under, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 

I am committed to continuing my education while seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge. I am eager to continue my education while contributing to a company's CyberSecurity and Software Engineering efforts.
