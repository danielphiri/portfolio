<i> 2021 - 2024 </i>

Taking a part-time online Master's program to improve my skills and understanding of cryptography and internet security in general. The program is designed for full-time employees so it works well with any work that I am focused on by allowing me to immediately apply school concepts in my work.

Skills: Linux · Cybersecurity · Internet Protocol (IP) · Internet Security · Web Applications · Linux

My program's primary goal was understanding how the human mind works by looking at it from different lenses which covered some broad areas including Computer Science, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy and Anthropology. My focus was on the computational side of things, which was built around computer science and artificial intelligence. 

This meant taking a lot of Computer Science classes. I took coursework in [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/), [User Interface Design and Development](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS160/), [Data Structures and algorithms](https://sp23.datastructur.es), [Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org), among others.

One of the most exciting computer science class I took was the [iOS Development Decal](https://iosdev.berkeley.edu) in Spring 2017. I enjoyed it so much that I became a Teaching Assistant the following semester. As a Teaching Assistant, I took up a project where I restructured and re-implemented some parts of the Snapchat-clone project, which was one of the larger projects and a pillar for the class. The changes received a lot of good feedback from students that semester. The following semester I was selected as one of the 3 Core Instructors for the class. We were supported by a team of about 8 Teaching Assistants to teach iOS Development concepts to a class of about 100 students. We had to run everything for the class starting from creating and grading assignments, giving lectures, running labs and office hours, to name a few. It was one of the most fulfilling experiences I had at the school.
